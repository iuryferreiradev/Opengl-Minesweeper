# OpenGL Minesweeper

This is my second OpenGL and C++ project, in this game i implemented spritesheets 
hover effects, left and right mouse button events and most of the minesweeper 
mechanics. Once again, taking in consideration that i am still learning the 
c++ language and OpenGL the code is not 100% well organized and optimized, check 
my latest projects for better code.
